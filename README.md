### 🎯 Primary Success Factors
- **Attendance** is the most powerful predictor of exam scores, suggesting that consistent classroom presence is more critical than any other factor
- **Hours Studied** ranks as the second most significant factor, but its impact is secondary to attendance, emphasizing the value of active participation
- The combination of attendance and study time creates a synergistic effect on academic performance

### 🏠 Environmental Impact
- **Parental Involvement** emerges as the most influential external factor, confirming that family support significantly contributes to higher scores
- **Access to Resources** plays a crucial role, highlighting the importance of a well-equipped learning environment
- Students with high parental involvement show consistently better performance across all study hour ranges

### 📈 Model Performance
- A straightforward **Linear Regression model outperformed** a more complex Polynomial model
- Achieved a robust **R-squared of 0.77**, explaining 77% of the variance in exam scores
- Maintained an impressively low average prediction error of just **1.8 points**
